Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager, included with Node.js)

 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd your-project

3. Install dependencies:

   npm install
  
   This will install Cypress and other required dependencies listed in `package.json`.

 Configuration

Cypress configurations can be set in the `cypress.json` file in the root directory. You can modify this file to set base URL, viewport settings, and other Cypress options.

Example `cypress.json`:

{
  "baseUrl": "https://developers.gitstart.com",
  "viewportWidth": 1280,
  "viewportHeight": 720
}


 Running Tests

1. Open Cypress Test Runner:
```
   npx cypress open
   ```

   This command opens the Cypress Test Runner GUI where you can select and run individual test cases.

2. Run Tests in Headless Mode:

   npx cypress run
   ```

   This command runs all the test cases in headless mode, suitable for Continuous Integration (CI) environments.

 Writing New Tests

1. Navigate to the `cypress/integration` directory.
2. Create a new test file (e.g., `example_spec.js`).
3. Write your test cases using Cypressâ€™s API.

Example test case:

describe('Landing Page', () => {
  it('directs user to landing page', () => {
    cy.visit('https://developers.gitstart.com/')
  })
})
